The subject of the master's thesis is a project of a serious game, which would familiarize the user with the assumptions of learning how to draw and present exercises that bring him closer to improving observation and drawing skills during the game. Knowledge about drawing, serious games and computer vision were used. The program was created on the Unity engine, in C#, with the use of external plugins, supporting individual application modules, e.g. downloading data from a graphics tablet, or creating a simple world for the player using 3D models with simple geometry. The game should be used with a graphics tablet. Its functionality has been translated into a drawing module, consisting of common graphic tools widely known in graphic programs, eg Adobe Photoshop, GIMP. The brush strokes are implemented using Catmull-Rom splines. After completing the exercises, the user has the opportunity to analyze the painted work, which the program will evaluate. The application will find objects using template matching methods, and present the results and details of the composition, e.g. the shades used in the original, or the average difference in values between pixels in the images.
